# hello-world
My first github project.

Hola everybody, I'm crackerjackmack1. I work mostly on .html, .js, and .css files for my church groups, friends, and myself.

I'm setting up this github account in an effort to learn how to use the <b>#1 VCS</b> (<b>V</b>ersion <b.C</b>ontrol <b>S</b>ystem) in the world (from what I've read and heard).

I've never used github before, and I'm so tired of saving copy after copy of file modifications in an effort to keep track of errors and magic bugs that just seem to appear out of nowhere.

If this makes it any easier to write, deploy and edit html pages, javascripts, stylesheets and web utilities then I've made a very good move.

And so, we shall see what we shall see, let the games begin...

See ya later.
