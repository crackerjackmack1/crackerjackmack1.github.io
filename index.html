	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<p>Hi, I'm Crackerjackmack! And this is my experimental web site. I have been busy for the last 5 years so,
		not much has been done here.
		When I started this site, so ago, I was in need of a cheap (free) online website where I could write, develope and 
		implement html, css, and javascript files that could be used to:
		<ul>
			<li>Track, display & print the amount of time spent on multiple projects worked concurrently.</li>
			<li>Select, display & print song lists, lyrics and song sets.</li>
			<li>Display the Holy Rosary in Latin.</li>
			<li>Open links to other religious websites.</li>
			<!--li></li-->
		</ul>
		My wife and I still use these to day.
		And at that time, GitHub was able to provide everything I needed to host my site, and they did it for free!
		They truly were a Godsend for someone who had no budget to do such a thing
	</p>
